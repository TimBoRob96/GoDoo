# GoDoo

The purpose of this app is to provide it's user with a choice of destinations using their location and a keyword that they provide. 

I use CoreLocation to identify the location and then feed this into the Google NearBy places Api. 

If you would like to clone and build this app yourself you will need to get your own Api for Google maps and create a K.Swift file with a struct that has the property apiKey containing your key as a string. 

If you would like to contribute or contact me regarding the project please get in touch via: timroberts96@icloud.com


List of future updates:
